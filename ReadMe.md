# Cheat Sheets

“_I'm not a great programmer; I'm just a good programmer with great habits._” - **Kent Beck**

One of those great habits is to keep a cheat sheet handy. This repository contains all the cheat sheets I have created over the years. I have tried to keep them as simple as possible. I hope you find them useful.

## Why Cheat Sheets?

Cheat sheets are a great way to keep track of all the commands you use on a daily basis. They are also a great way to learn new commands. I have found that the best way to learn a new command is to write it down on a cheat sheet. This way you can refer to it whenever you need it.

Also it makes you get in a habit of writing good documentation, which is a very essential skill to have for all programmers.

## Tools Used

I use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to create my cheat sheets. It is a great tool for creating notes and organizing them. It has a great UI and is very easy to use. I highly recommend it for note taking.
